## Description 

This challenge was definitely .... a challenge. This was my first assignment to create all my code from scratch which was fine at first but going back and forth between the html and css proved to be perilous
once i needed to style and position other things on the page. In the futre I will absolutely be writing all my HMTL first and then making the necessary adjustments in CSS
